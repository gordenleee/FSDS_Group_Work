## 1. Who collected the data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )
.

:

An inline citation: As elucidated by Inside Airbnb (n.d.), this independent entity systematically collects detailed data points on Airbnb listings, such as location coordinates, host information, pricing, reviews, and occupancy rates. Concurrently, the UK Government's COVID-19 data portal (UK Government, n.d.) aggregates comprehensive statistics, including daily infection rates, hospitalization numbers, testing figures, and vaccination rates across various regions, including London.

A parenthetical citation: Detailed data on Airbnb's market, encompassing fields like listing amenities, length of stay, and host response rates, has been methodically collated by Inside Airbnb (Inside Airbnb, n.d.). Simultaneously, the UK Government has been meticulously recording public health metrics such as case numbers, the R reproduction number, and local alert levels, essential for public awareness and policy-making during the pandemic (UK Government, n.d.).... 

## 2. Why did they collect it?

::: {.duedate}

( 4 points; Answer due Week 7 )


An inline citation: Inside Airbnb (n.d.) gathered data to shed light on how short-term rentals influence local housing markets, while the UK Government's data portal (n.d.) aims to track the progress and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating informed decision-making and policy development.

A parenthetical citation: The collection of data by Inside Airbnb (n.d.) serves to enhance transparency around the effects of short-term rentals on housing, complemented by the UK Government's COVID-19 data (n.d.), which is essential for understanding the pandemic's broader socioeconomic impacts, including its influence on housing and rental markets.
:::

```{python}
print(f"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]:,}")
```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the data collected?  

::: {.duedate}

( 5 points; Answer due Week 8 )

The data on Airbnb listings was collected by Inside Airbnb, which employs web scraping to systematically compile information from publicly available listings on the Airbnb platform. This includes data such as geographic coordinates, host details, pricing strategies, and customer reviews. The UK Government's COVID-19 data was collated via a dedicated data portal, which aggregates a wide range of public health statistics derived from official health databases and reporting systems, providing a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's progression.

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

::: {.duedate}

( 11 points; Answer due Week 9 )

The web scraping method used by Inside Airbnb may not capture every listing or update in real-time, potentially leading to gaps in data or lag in reflecting current market conditions. Government data is typically robust but may be limited by reporting delays or revisions. These collection methods could affect the completeness and accuracy of the representation of Airbnb's market dynamics and the pandemic's impact on housing. Wider issues include the reliability of secondary data sources for policy formulation and the ethical considerations around the use of scraped data.
